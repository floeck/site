Dear reader,

Over the last two or so days the dust has to a degree, settled within my mind. I'm still not right, but I'm at the stage where I can get on with my life a little and work on some projects I've been leaving for wayyy to long.

The things I'd like to work on at the moment are...
* Personal website overhaul, landing page etc
* New project idea: PigeonsTalk (still working on the name... can you tell lol)
* New blog series, starting with Egypt
* Get back into German course (stop start this 24/7)

The project is interesting, and I'll lay forth exactly what I have in mind at this stage of its infancy.

Essentially, given the pandemic and all, it can be hard to talk to people. Yes, we have all the social media and amazing platforms left right and center at our fingertips, but I still think there is room for improvement.

The platform would act as follows. Upon entering the landing page, a few 'bubbles' appear, with #hashtags that precursor a title and small body like follows.

#books #pandemic #fuck
Title: Let's talk about murakami 
Body: Struggling a bit, anyone want to have a discussion about this bloke?

Each 'bubble' would float on the home page and last only a few moments. Once clicked on, you enter a conversation with the person.

I want people to be able to talk to anyone about anything, as easy as humanely possible. Given the anonymous nature of the platform, you decide with your chatting partner how much you choose to reveal. And if you're unhappy, you can simply block or exit the conversation, returning to the home page.

There will also be an option to search for specific tags.

Each user themselves will have the ability to 'blow' a bubble, releasing it to the world. For starters this will just be Melbourne as I get it going.

I imagine a use case where shit, I just went through some heavy shit and I want to vent to someone who's not involved with it all. Yes friends are great here, but sometimes we do just want to talk to someone we do not know, with no prior thoughts or ideas about us.

You can get an interesting perspective that can otherwise be biased from friends. I want to quickly double down on the fact that I love my friends, and I don't want to lead anyone into believing that you shouldn't talk to your mates about things. But not everyone has that luxury (having friends that is), whether that be for numerous reasons such as geographical isolation etc. But I just want people to be able to communicate and help each other, wherever they are, in whatever situation they may be in.

Sometimes you may want to chat to someone to help, and others you want to ask someone else to join you. I believe this platform could help many people. There's something interesting about talking to a complete stranger. I find we're not as different as we think sometimes, after all we're all human.

This isn't to say we're not unique blah blah blah, I mean as Sagan once said, you'll never in a billion years or so meet another alike. But what I mean is that I strongly believe there is always something to be found in common with one another, no matter how polarsing the character may seem. Which I think is a beautiful thing.

There's more to flesh out here, but it's a start. A very raw one.

The blog series is an interesting one. I only noticed the other day that the time between posts had reached exactly a whole year, which is quite the coinkydink.

A blog series I believe will help me get back into regularly blogging. But I feel this may not even be necessary. But nevertheless, Egypt, I got my eyes on you, and that weird sphinx.

Until next time, 
Oskar
