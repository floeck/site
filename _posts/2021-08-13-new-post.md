Dear you,

I went for quite the walk today, exploring some new parts of my suburb. Found a cool looking park which was noice. Being in the sun reminded me of you, and I thought I'd check in. I tried to reach out, to see if you were okay. A simple text, saying hello, no need to respond, just me again, seeing how you're doing.. But I think I've been blocked. And it makes me sad. I could send a letter, and thought of calling, but the last thing I want is to pressure you in any which way.

I'm confliced now, on all fronts. I understand you need space, and have given you for the best part of a week or so, but given the lockdown and all that I thought I'd just check in. But I can't. Maybe it's neccessary, and I shouldn't have even tried to get in contact, but I care about you too much.

I don't hate you, and don't think I could ever. I just hope your feelings towards me haven't turned sour, as it would be a shame. If you do come across this at some point, I hope you're okay, and doing well this lockdown. It's been tough for me.

I hope at some point in the future we do speak again, as the short time we spent together added real value to my life, and I want you to continue to be part of that, whether that be as friends, or whatevever. Regardless of the connection "phrase", you made me a better person.

Kind Regards,
Oskar
