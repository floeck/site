Dear Oskar from the future,

You're back. But you never really left! Secretly you've been posting in the shadows, wait is it we? Is it I?

Anyways, yes. Let's move on..

Defenestration. What a word, and even more interesting history.

Definition of `defenestration`, as provided by [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defenestration).

| 1 : a throwing of a person or thing out of a window
| 2 : a usually swift dismissal or expulsion (as from a political party or office) 

e.g. assassination by defenestration (there's four s's in assassination? cool)

Let's be real. The first definition provided here is the real answer. More interestingly, let's take a little stroll through not so recent history to see where this word became popularised.

These days defenestration is often used to describe the forceful removal of someone from public office or from some other advantageous position. History’s most famous defenestration, however, was one in which the tossing out the window was quite literal. On May 23, 1618, two imperial regents were found guilty of violating certain guarantees of religious freedom. As punishment, they were thrown out the window of Prague Castle. The men survived the 50-foot tumble into the moat, but the incident, which became known as the Defenestration of Prague, marked the beginning of the Bohemian resistance to Hapsburg rule that eventually led to the Thirty Years' War.
